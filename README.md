This is a layered approach project.
In this we have Controller, Service and DAO layer(JDBC).
Step1 - Here i am taking input data from user in String form and keeping it in VO(value object).
Step2 - Value object will be converted into DTO i.e. Data Transfer Object and in DTO variables are of its respective types.
Step3 - Now DTO will be converted into BO(Business Object) which will interact with persistance logic for database management.
